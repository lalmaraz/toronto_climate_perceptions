# Based on Michael Chong's excellent work, as published in Telling Stories With Data (Alexander, 2021) here:

# The nice way* to import dataset:

# search_packages("climate") %>% 
#   list_package_resources() %>% 
#   filter(grepl("v1", name)) %>% 
#   get_resource()

# * this is commented out because there seems to be an issue with the original file extension (listed as .xls but behaves as .xlsx)
# contacted data owner 29032021, issue persists as of 17042021 with error:
#   "filepath: /var/folders/ff/yckwhmhx69jbjdlphv588lv80000gn/T//RtmpAD7G0d/file14a6c14da63d9.xls"
#   "libxls error: Unable to open file"

# Here's a less elegant but functional workaround:
